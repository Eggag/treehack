Then rate the similarity of the two given problems on a scale from 1 to 10, and output that rating enclosed in curly braces. Differences in wording, context, and details must be ignored completely â€“ only focus on what the problems require you to find. For the problems to be similar, the specific steps and ideas for getting to the solution must be almost identical for both of them. Being in the same broad category does not mean the problems are similar, the category must be very specific."
